## 🤖 **Why LLaMA 3.2 Vision?**

I used **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** as the LLM (Large Language Model) because:
- It’s **super powerful** and can analyze images (like our stock charts) 🖼️.
- It provides **detailed, actionable insights** based on technical indicators 📈.
- It’s **open-source** and easy to integrate with Python 🐍.

Here’s what the dashboard looks like in action:
